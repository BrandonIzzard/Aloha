What  I learned?

How hard it is to work under a tight schedule. Getting a grasp on Javascript and jQuery. 
Fine tuning my skills of HTML and CSS. All lead to knowing that everyday I get slightly better. 
Pracitce is very important for each language and the more I do it the more I realize how much I could have learned if I put in the effort earlier.
Google will always be my good friend when I'm stuck.
